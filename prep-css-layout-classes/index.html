        <h3>Batman Begins</h3>
        <p>A young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard
        (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. When Ducard reveals the League's true purpose -- the
        complete destruction of Gotham City -- Wayne returns to Gotham intent on cleaning up the city without resorting to
        murder. With the help of Alfred (Michael Caine), his loyal butler, and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at
        Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.</p>

        <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
        <p>With the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Christian Bale) has
        been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker (Heath
        Ledger) suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and
        vigilantism.</p>

        <h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
        <p>It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale), in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), vanished
        into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed everything for what he and
        Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) and a merciless
        terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.</p>
